                <p>The masses clash in one of the bloodiest battles this mountain has seen since the beginning of time.</p>

                    creature of this plane has ever witnessed, neither survived.</p>
                <p>The fires rage on for another one hundred moons before the smoke finally settles down, revealing the new landscape, purified of any life.</p>

                    and grows bigger, as its floors rush through the air.</p>
                <p>Finally, as the trembling quiets, the tower stands, immobile. The goblins can be seen fleeing,

                <p>As each of your mightiest of brothers fall at the hands of these terrible brutes, the ever heavier
                    gloom and despair befalls the Dwarven race. The cackle and primitive cries of victory fill all the
                    nooks and crannies of the Everlast mountain. As some of your brothers cling to their weapons, the
                    terror shakes their hands, making them lose their grip.</p>

                <p>As your kind is being chased away by the goblins, trying to pack whatever they can, save whatever
                    they are able to, columns of dwarves can be seen expelling from the Everlast's many caverns.
                    Family to family, they cling to each other, trying to regroup and reform under the dim light of the dusk.</p>
                <p>As basic camps form and night befalls the region, some groups of dwarves can be seen quietly moving
                    away from the clan, never to be seen again. In the morning sun, not two thirds of the Everlast clan can be found.
                    Those remaining gather their belongings and as the realisation of the consequences fully materialise,
                    many can be seen sobbing or fall into stupor, barely able to march.</p>
